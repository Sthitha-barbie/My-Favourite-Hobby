        <p> I love to paint when I have free time. It makes your imagination boast and makes you skilled in painting. Whenever I come from school, I open my drawing book and start painting the first thing that pops into my mind. I am in 4th std. I like trying new things -- Like yesterday, I tried to do dot paint and today, I learnt how to merge acrylic colours. I take help from my art teacher whenever I have a doubt about painting. She helps me a lot. My art teacher is very proud of me and I love her :). </p>
